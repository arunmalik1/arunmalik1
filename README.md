### About Me

My name is Arun Malik and I am a data scientist. I discovered my love for data while working in hospitality where I used customer feedback, sales reports and inventory management to increase profitability. Hospitality taught me problem-solving skills, attention to detail and the ability to communicate with all stakeholders. My goal is to continue to grow my skills and help businesses increase efficiency.

### Hi there 👋

### About Me

My name is Arun Malik and I discovered my love for data while working in hospitality where I used customer feedback, sales reports and inventory management to increase profitability. Hospitality taught me problem-solving skills, attention to detail and the ability to communicate with all stakeholders. My goal is to continue to grow my skills and help businesses increase efficiency.

### What I'm up too:

🔭 Recent graduate of the Flatiron School and I'm continuing to grow my skillset<br />
👯 Open to collaborate on data and machine learning projects that tell interesting stories and/or have a social impact<br />
💬 Ask me about neural networks for image classification with Keras/Tensorflow<br />
🌱 Outside of working on tech, I love boxing and economics<br />
🗽 NYC-based

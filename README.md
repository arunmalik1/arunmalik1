### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

After graduating high school I entered the work force in the hospitality business. After 25 years of service I decided to go back to college, where I discovered my love for economics and data science. 
 
I used the data from customer feedback, sales reports and inventory management to increase profitability. Hospitality taught me problem-solving skills, attention to detail and the ability to communicate with all stakeholders. I look forward to helping businesses achieve their goals with data.

### What I'm up too:

ðŸ”­ Recent graduate of the Flatiron School and I'm continuing to grow my skillset<br />
ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborate on data and machine learning projects that tell interesting stories and/or have a social impact<br />
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about neural networks for image classification with Keras/Tensorflow<br />
ðŸŒ± Outside of working on tech, I love boxing and economics<br />
ðŸ—½ NYC-based
